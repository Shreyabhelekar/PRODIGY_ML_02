# Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
This project uses the K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. By identifying distinct customer segments, businesses can better understand their customer base and implement targeted marketing strategies, personalized recommendations, and improved customer retention techniques.

# Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, standardizes data, and prepares it for clustering.

Customer Segmentation: Groups customers into clusters based on their purchase history.

Visualization: Provides intuitive plots and charts to visualize the clustering results.

Insights: Helps in understanding customer behavior and creating actionable strategies.

# Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Shreyabhelekar/PRODIGY_ML_02.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd PRODIGY_ML_02.git

Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage

Ensure you have a dataset containing customer purchase history (e.g., customer_data.csv).

Run the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook TASK_2_Grouping_Customers.ipynb

Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data, apply K-means clustering, and analyze results.

# Dataset

The dataset should include key features such as:

Customer ID

Purchase amount

Frequency of purchases

Demographics (optional)

If no dataset is provided, the notebook includes a sample dataset for demonstration purposes.

# Results
Cluster Analysis: Each cluster represents a unique customer segment with shared purchase patterns.

Visualizations: Includes scatter plots, elbow method graphs, and more to explain results.

# Technologies Used

Python
Libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
